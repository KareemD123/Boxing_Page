              Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing
              protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand
              wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a
              predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. Amateur boxing is
              both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard
              fixture in most international games—it also has its own World
              Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of
              one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds.

              A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when
              a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing,
              disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent.
              When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both
              opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the
              victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges,
              then professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing,
              because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one
              fighter on technical criteria.

              The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian
              relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BC.[2] A relief sculpture
              from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 BC) shows both boxers and
              spectators.[2] These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions
              showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a
              band supporting the wrist.[2] The earliest evidence of fist
              fighting with the use of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete (c.
              1500–1400 BC).[2]

              Various types of boxing existed in ancient India. The earliest
              references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as
              the Ramayana and Rig Veda. The Mahabharata describes two
              combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks,
              finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.[3] Duels (niyuddham)
              were often fought to the death.[citation needed] During the period
              of the Western Satraps, the ruler Rudradaman—in addition to being
              well-versed in "the great sciences" which included Indian
              classical music, Sanskrit grammar, and logic—was said to be an
              excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and
              boxer.[4] The Gurbilas Shemi, an 18th-century Sikh text, gives
              numerous references to musti-yuddha.

              A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of
              three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. A minute is
              typically spent between each round with the fighters in their
              assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach
              and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within
              the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on
              their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and
              rule on fouls.

              Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the
              bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows
              that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more
              subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing
              judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or
              both fighters believe they have been "robbed" or unfairly denied a
              victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where
              their coach, as well as one or more "seconds" may administer to
              the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each
              boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the
              beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to
              their corner at the signalled end of each round.
